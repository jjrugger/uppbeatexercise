# Joel's Uppbeat search

## Technology Used

- Next.js using app router
- Tailwind CSS
- lucide - For icons
- ShadCN - For UI boilerplate

Use `npm run dev` in order to start local host.

**What I found difficult**:
I had not really ventured into react query before but decided to give it a go with the API, it required a little bit of trial and error to get working correctly.

**What I excelled at**:
I was efficient in my use of Tailwind in conjunction with lucide and ShadCN to style the page, doing both mobile and desktop styling quickly left me more time to work on the functionality.
I also checked the to make sure it fit accessibility needs for both best practice and current standards.

**Estimated time taken**: 5hrs

**What i'd improve given more time**:
I would add a custom select arrow to the Tracks/ SFX.
Add animations to the search results as they appear and as more get added.
Make use of additional API data such as associated styles or marking if a song is explicit.
